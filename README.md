# Predicting-Google-Play-Store-App-Ratings-with-Machine-Learning-
In this project, I transformed raw Google Play Store data into business-ready insights and built a predictive model that can forecast an app’s rating before launch.

📌 Achievements:

✅ Model Accuracy using Logistic Regression.

📊 Identified top rating drivers – reviews count, category, app size, and pricing.

🔍 Built interactive visualizations revealing category-wise performance & install trends.

🧠 Compared multiple ML models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to select the most accurate.

⚙ Tools & Tech: Python | Pandas | NumPy | Matplotlib | Seaborn | Scikit-learn

💡 Impact: Developers and businesses can now leverage these insights to strategically improve app features, pricing, and category targeting — leading to higher ratings, more downloads, and better market positioning.
